# *EEG Data Analysis* #
Monitoring brain waves in Meditative and Non-Meditative states using EEG with the goal of building a classification model to predict the state (Meditative vs Non-Meditative)

# *TO DO:* # 

##1. Collection:##
[x]Collection of EEG amplitude data in 3 states: Meditative,     Casually Thinking and Reading a fiction novel (One test subject)
[ ]Collection in Meditative state of second test subject

##2. Cleaning:##
[x]Resampling the  time-series data into intervels of 16 miliseconds 
[ ]Smoothening the data and removing EEG artifacts

##3. Analysis:##
[x]Performing Fast Fourier Transformation to produce Frequency-Amplitude data 
[ ]Performing Wavelet transformation
[ ]Using stock-market indicators for inference 
[ ]Identifying the smallest quantum to determine a meditative state
[ ]Building a classification tool to predict the brain states
